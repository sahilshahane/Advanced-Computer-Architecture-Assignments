# Embedding Operation with Software Prefetch Optimization & SIMD -Embed it

In this part of the assignment we want you to implements an optimised embedding operation with software prefetch instructions and SIMD instructions to improve cache performance and reduce memory latency.
Understand the code for embedding operation given in  `emb.cpp`, and do the necessary changes to incorporate software prefetching & SIMD

## Compilation

To build the optimised embedding implementation:
```bash
make emb
```

## Usage

After compilation, run the optimised embedding operation:
```
./emb
```

## Expected Deliverables 

Make a folder `plots` and add the supporting plots inside that folder. Along with that create a `cache_effect.pdf` reporting and documenting the analysis you did in this part of the assignment.


Good luck embedding the solutions :)
